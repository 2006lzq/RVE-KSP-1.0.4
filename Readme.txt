IF you have a serious game breaking bug post screens

Expect frequent memory crashes on 32 bit :/

Requirements:

1) RSS 10.2
2) Scatterer
3) EVE-OverhaulBranch - Get the x86-Release.zip from here: https://github.com/rbray89/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/blob/Overhaul/x86-Release.zip    (Click Raw to DL)
4) NO other cloud configs present in gamedata e.g. like in BoulderCo folder.


Recommended:

PlanetShine
WindowReflections
Distant object enhancements 
(for realistic planet and skybox brightness)
A custom Skybox
 (Blubber monkey's and Proots are the best IMO)
CameraTools


Installation/use:

1) DL and install scatterer (ignor info about RSS compatability and intall Scatterer as if on stock KSP)

2a) DL EVE overhaul (adress above).
2b) Put EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements folder and BoulderCo folder into KSP/Gamedata
2c) Go into BoulderCo folder and delete the Atmosphere, CityLights, and Terrain folders

3a) DL and install RVE by dragging Scatterer and RVE folders into your Gamedata (ignor other files)
3b) (optional) Place shared assets file from your RVE into your KSP_data folder for RVE sun texture and lens flare
 (overwrite)
 - Ignore .git files and README.md

4) Enjoy.. maybe.. if it actually works



Bugs/WIP:

EVE-GUI APPLY BUTTON WILL CAUSE SERIOUS BUGS WHEN IN LOW ORBIT and possibly at other times
No other planets worked on other than Earth (and that's only half done)
ScaledSpace/Orbital ground textures only, no detail ground texture currently
Using the TrackingStation to switch to vessels in orbit will cause problems
Possibly flashing clouds when in atmosphere
Extremely High memory usage for Windows users... still...
Atmosphere looks unrealistically high from Orbit (working on getting a fix for this)
Terrain detail isn't realistic and won't make sense at times (e.g. Mountains in flat region or Vice versa)
Terrain detail in ocean when in orbit
Blue bands in horizon at very low altitudes 
Break in horizon line at all PQS altitudes
Texture borders in cloud detail
Snow areas are brown/orange in space


What I had to do to get this working:

Removed All RSS texures bar Earth and Moon (might not be necessary)
Only used 2k RSS textures
Intall ATM agressive
Run in OpenGL
Run with vertually no mods installed other than RSS/RO/Scatterer/RVE

And it still crashes :P
