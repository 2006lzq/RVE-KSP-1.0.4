Expect frequent memory crashes :/

Requirements:

RSS 10.2+

EVE-OverhaulBranch - Get the x86-Release.zip from here: https://github.com/rbray89/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/blob/Overhaul/x86-Release.zip    (Click Raw to DL)

NO other cloud configs present in gamedata e.g. like in BoulderCo folder.


Recommended:

PlanetShine

WindowReflections

Distant object enhancements 
(for realistic planet and skybox brightness)

A custom Skybox
 (Blubber monkey's and Proots are the best IMO)

CameraTools



Installation/use:

1- DL and install scatterer (ignor info about RSS compatability and intall Scatterer as if on stock KSP)

2- DL EVE overhaul (adress above).
2a- Put EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements folder and BoulderCo folder into KSP/Gamedata
2b- Go into BoulderCo folder and delete the Atmosphere, CityLights, and Terrain folders

3- DL and install RVE by dragging Scatterer and RVE folders into your Gamedata (ignor other files)

3b(optional)- Place shared assets file from your RVE into your KSP_data folder for RVE sun texture and lens flare
 (overwrite but keep backup of original sharedassets9.assets)
 - Ignore .git files and README.md

5- Enjoy.. maybe..



Bugs/WIP:

EVE-GUI APPLY BUTTON WILL CAUSE SERIOUS BUGS WHEN IN LOW ORBIT and possibly at other times

No other planets worked on other than Earth (and that's only half done)

ScaledSpace/Orbital ground textures only, no detail ground texture currently

Using the TrackingStation to switch to vessels in orbit will cause problems

Possibly flashing clouds when in atmosphere

Extremely High memory usage for Windows users... still...

Atmosphere looks unrealistically high from Orbit (working on getting a fix for this)

Terrain detail isn't realistic and won't make sense at times (e.g. Mountains in flat region or Vice versa)

Terrain detail in ocean when in orbit

Blue bands in horizon at very low altitudes 

Break in horizon line at all PQS altitudes

Texture borders in cloud detail

What I had to do to get this working:
Removed All RSS texures bar Earth and Moon (might not be necessary)
Only used 2k RSS textures
Intall ATM agressive
Run in OpenGL
Run with vertually no mods installed other than RSS/RO/Scatterer/RVE

And it still crashes :P
