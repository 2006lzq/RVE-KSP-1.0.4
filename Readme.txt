Recommended:
  PlanetShine
  WindowShine
  Distant object enhancements
      (for appropriate planet and skybox brightness)
  Texture replacer (for custom RVE skybox textures)
      (else Blubber monkey's and Proots are the best IMO)
  CameraTools
  
Installation/use:
 0- This probably won't work if you're not on x64 and with at least 4-8GB RAM 
 1- Download the RVE Linux-Branch Zip
 2- Install all required mods first
 3- Place all RVE folders from Zip into your Gamedata folder (overwriting) unless you don't want RVE skybox or texture replacer.
 4- Ignore .git and README.md looking files
  - You WILL need to go to launchpad/Runway before switching to craft in space
 5- Enjoy.. maybe..
